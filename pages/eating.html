       <h2 class="centered">Kyle... the Semi-Picky Eater?</h2>
       <p class="indent">To know who I am as an eater, one must first know my eating habits. 
           I’d consider myself to be a semi-picky eater and a food-texturist (yes i made up this word). 
           I’m not all the way picky, but I definitely have my moments. Most of my food hang ups are pretty context based and conditional. 
           By this I mean that my opinion about a particular food item changes depending on what’s around it. 
           You’re thinking to yourself, that’s pretty normal, but just wait.</p>
           <div class="underline centered">Exhibit A: Cheese</div>
           <div class="note centered">Before I start, I should say I have no idea how these things came to be, 
               but I’m convinced that something had to have happened.</div>
           <p class="indent">I LOVE Mac and Cheese and Quesadillas - and pizza. And while there are some pretty 
               strange combos of cheese that can throw off these dishes for me, 
            I’d say they’re both one of my safe bets. Meaning I’ll eat it anytime, anywhere. However, put 
            ANY kind of cheese on my burger (or sandwhich) and 
            I will almost certainly become nauseous.</p>
            <p class="indent">When I was younger, I would always ask for no cheese on my hamburgers from McDonald’s, but of course, 
                occasionally, I would unwrap this perfectly made creation only to find cheese - and onions, but more on that later. 
                Many a car ride home from McDonald’s, I would be expertly perform life-preseving surgery for burgers, making sure 
                to act fast so that the cheese wouldn’t melt beyound the point of saving.</p>
            <p class="outro centered">Everything that I’ve said, applies to all burgers and sandwiches alike.<br>
                To summarize:<br>
            Quesadilla and Mac and Cheese: happy face<br>
            Burger or Sandwhich with Cheese: sad face</p>
            <div class="underline centered">Exhibit B: Onions (& Bell Peppers)</div>
            <div class="note centered">No. Never. Just no thank you. I’ll eat around them.</div>
            <p class="indent">Okay to be fair I can get through eating some onions, but it’s just that, 
                getting through, my eating experience is enhanced tenfold without the presence of onions…<br>
                <strong>My reasoning?</strong>
                The texture… no matter what you put onions in they are always noticeable…<br>
                And for some reason me, my brain, and tastebuds would rather life without.</p>
            <p class="outro centered">That’s all. (Same applies to bell peppers)</p>
            <div class="underline centered">Exhibit C: Broccoli & Cabbage</div>
            <p class="indent">Abolish both of these vegetables right now. I have never liked either since as far back as I can 
                    remember. Yet, for some reason, my household was <strong>always</strong> eating either broccoli or 
                    cabbage as the vegetable for dinner… </p>
            <p class="outro centered">I'd say I'm justified</p>
            <div class="underline centered">Exhibit D: Mushrooms</div>
            <p class="indent">If Im being honest, mushrooms have really never done any wrong to me, it’s really just their 
                texture… I get squeamish thinking about cooked mushrooms.</p>
            <div class="underline centered">Exhibit E: Chocolate</div>
            <p class="indent">Yes, you read that right. If you read this far, I feel that you deserve to know that I do not 
                in fact like chocolate; though, there are a few exceptions. I CAN eat chocolate as long as its not too chocolatey… 
                For example, I like snickers and most chocolate-caramel combinations but nothing more chocolatey than that. 
                Sometimes I’ll eat brownies and cookies, but I really could live without it… </p>
            <p class="outro centered">I’m just more of a french vanilla or vanilla bean gal myself.<br>
                Dark chocolate?! NEVER!!</p>

       <h4>Disclaimer: I really can't cook :(</h4>
       <p class="indent">Disclaimer aside.. When I do cook, you can almost guarantee it's a product from Trader Joe's. Since I’m not the most 
           adventurous foodie, here’s a list of the things I usually buy - and survive off of -  from trader joes.</p>
